# Customer Segmentation and Churn Analysis in the Telco Industry

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation and Churn Analysis project in the Telco industry! In the fast-paced world of telecommunications, understanding customer behavior is crucial for ensuring business success. This project focuses on leveraging Tableau to perform customer segmentation and churn analysis, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making and customer retention efforts.

**Introduction**

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly vying for customer attention and loyalty. To thrive in this environment, telecom companies must gain a deep understanding of their customer base and tailor their services to meet their evolving needs. Customer segmentation and churn analysis are key tools in this endeavor, allowing companies to identify distinct customer segments and predict potential churn.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer data from a Telco company and derive actionable insights using Tableau. By segmenting customers based on their demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant factors, we aim to uncover meaningful trends and preferences. Additionally, we seek to identify customers at risk of churn and develop strategies to mitigate churn and improve customer retention.

**Dataset**

We utilize a comprehensive dataset containing customer information, including demographic data, service usage, contract details, and churn status. This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis, enabling us to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.

**Methodology**

1. Data Exploration and Preparation
We start by exploring and cleaning the raw data, ensuring its quality and consistency for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting the data for compatibility with Tableau.

2. Customer Segmentation
Using Tableau's powerful visualization tools, we segment customers based on various criteria, such as age, gender, location, service usage, and tenure. This allows us to identify distinct customer groups with unique characteristics and preferences.

3. Churn Analysis
We analyze churn behavior within different customer segments, identifying factors that contribute to churn and predicting potential churners. This analysis enables us to develop targeted retention strategies aimed at reducing churn and improving customer loyalty.
